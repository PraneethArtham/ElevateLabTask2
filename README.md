# ElevateLabTask2

##  Objective

To understand the dataset deeply by:
- Summarizing the data
- Visualizing distributions
- Spotting relationships between variables
- Identifying outliers and skewness



##  What I Explored

| Step | What I Did | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| 1️⃣ | Printed summary stats (`mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, etc.) | To understand how the numbers behave |
| 2️⃣ | Made **histograms** | To see the distribution of values like Age & Fare |
| 3️⃣ | Drew **boxplots** | To check for outliers visually |
| 4️⃣ | Created a **correlation heatmap** | To find which features are related |
| 5️⃣ | Made a **pairplot** | To compare multiple features together |
| 6️⃣ | Checked **skewness** | To see if features are normally distributed |
| 7️⃣ | Plotted **survival vs gender/class** | To uncover key survival patterns |

## Interview Questions – and My Answers

| 1. What's the purpose of EDA? 
      To explore, understand, and prepare data before modeling 
| 2. How do boxplots help?   
    They show the spread of data and highlight outliers
| 3. What is correlation? 
    A number showing how two variables are related (from -1 to +1) 
| 4. How do you detect skewness? 
      Using `.skew()` function or by looking at histograms 
| 5. What is multicollinearity?  
      When features are too similar to each other, confusing the model 
| 6. Tools for EDA?   
    Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly 
| 7. Has EDA helped you find problems before? 
      Yes! For example, it showed outliers in Titanic fares and missing values in ages 
| 8. What’s the role of visuals in ML? 
    To find insights quickly and communicate clearly
